**Error Log Analysis**

The error log indicates that the `ModuleNotFoundError` is caused by the missing `numpy` module. This suggests that the failing command is the Python script `example.py` that attempts to import the `numpy` module.

**Corrected Code**

To fix the issue, we need to install the `numpy` module. Assuming that the CI/CD pipeline is running on a Linux-based system, we can use pip to install the `numpy` module.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
filename: example.py
command: ["pip", "install", "numpy"]
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
```

In this corrected code, we've added a command to install the `numpy` module using pip. We've also updated the import statement to use the correct alias `np` for the `numpy` module.

**Explanation**

The failing command is the Python script `example.py` that attempts to import the `numpy` module without installing it first. To fix the issue, we need to install the `numpy` module using pip. We can do this by adding a command to the CI/CD pipeline to install the `numpy` module before running the Python script.
